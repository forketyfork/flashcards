Basic
Front: 
Describe the RICE framework for prioritization.
Back: 
- R = Reach: how many people will the initiative reach within the given time frame
- I = Impact: reflects a qualitative or quantitative goal:
	- 3 = massive impact
	- 2 = high impact
	- 1 = medium impact
	- 0.5 = low impact
	- 0.25 = minimal impact
- C = Confidence, helps control the projects where we have data to support one factor (reach, impact) but rely on "gut feeling" for the other:
	- 100% — high confidence
	- 80% — medium confidence
	- 50% — low confidence
	- Lower than 50% — "moonshot"
- E = Effort, total number of resources needed to complete this initiative within the time frame (estimated similar to Reach)
The RICE score is calculated as `R * I * C / E`. Different initiatives are compared according to this score and placed on the roadmap.
