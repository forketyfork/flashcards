START
Basic
Front: What causes performance issues with failing inserts in PostgreSQL?
Back: Repeated transaction rollbacks and accumulation of dead tuples, which lead to table bloat and increased autovacuum activity.

START
Basic
Front: How can PostgreSQL handle insert conflicts efficiently?
Back: By using the `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` clause to skip inserts that would violate constraints without raising errors or causing rollbacks.

Basic
Front: What SQL query can check autovacuum activity on a specific PostgreSQL table?
Back: `SELECT relname, last_autovacuum, autovacuum_count FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE relname='your_table_name';`

START
Basic
Front: What is a dead tuple in PostgreSQL?
Back: A dead tuple is a row that has been deleted or obsoleted but not yet removed from disk, contributing to table bloat until vacuumed.

START
Basic
Front: What are the benefits of using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in high-throughput systems?
Back: It prevents exceptions and rollbacks on constraint violations, reduces dead tuples, minimizes autovacuum runs, and improves overall performance.

START
Basic
Front: How does table bloat affect PostgreSQL performance?
Back: Table bloat increases disk usage, slows down queries and inserts, and leads to more frequent autovacuum operations.

START
Basic
Front: What is the purpose of PostgreSQL's autovacuum process?
Back: To automatically clean up dead tuples, reclaim storage, and maintain database performance by preventing table bloat.
