What is the fundamental nature of Group Theory?
Back:
Group Theory primarily deals with patterns and symmetry, not just numbers.

What are the four key observations/rules that define a group, as demonstrated by the Rubik's Cube?
Back:
1.  **Predefined List of Actions** \[[04:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=256)\]: There's a fixed set of moves.
2.  **Every Action is Reversible** \[[04:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=281)\]: Any move or sequence can be undone.
3.  **Every Action is Deterministic** \[[04:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=299)\]: The outcome of an action is predictable.
4.  **Moves Can Be Combined** \[[05:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=317)\]: Any sequence of actions is also a valid action.

Informally, what is a group?
Back:
A group is a set of actions that satisfy the four rules (predefined, reversible, deterministic, combinable) \[[10:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=641)\].

What is the distinction between "actions" and "configurations" in the context of group theory?
Back:
A group is a set of *actions* (things you do, like twisting faces), not the *configurations* (the different states of the cube). However, there's a one-to-one correspondence between distinct actions and distinct configurations when starting from a solved state \[[15:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=924)\].

What are "generators" in group theory?
Back:
Generators \[[09:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=590)\] are a small subcollection of actions that can produce all other actions within the group. For the Rubik's Cube, the six 90-degree clockwise twists of its faces are generators \[[12:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=759)\].

When are two sequences of moves considered "equivalent" in group theory?
Back:
Two sequences of moves are considered the same if they result in the same net effect \[[11:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwTQdOop-nU&t=682)\].
