Definition of a single-variable polynomial with real coefficients. Define coefficient, degree, and root of a polynomial.
Back: A single variable polynomial with real coefficients is a function $f$ that takes a real number as input, produces a real number as output, and has the form:

$f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...+a_nx^n$,

where the $a_i$ are real numbers. The $a_i$ are called coefficients of $f$. The degree of the polynomial is the integer $n$.

A *root* of a polynomial $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a value $z$ for which $f(z)=0$.
