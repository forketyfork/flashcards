Front: What does promoting a build mean?
Back: 
Build promotion is manually triggering a custom build with an overridden artifact or snapshot dependency. It's triggered by running Actions -> Promote. Then you can select a dependent build that will be executed with this build in the chain, instead of the one specified in the dependency. It only affects a single run of this dependent build.
