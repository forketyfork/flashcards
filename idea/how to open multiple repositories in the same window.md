Back: 
While one repo is open as a project, select `File -> New -> Module from Existing sources`, open the directory with the second repo and select either `Create module from existing sources` or `Import module from external model`, then click `Create`. You can click on the module in the `Project` view and select `Remove module` to remove it from the project structure.
